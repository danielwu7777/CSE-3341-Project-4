add frame for main at the start (before executing stmtSeq)

example code 4:

save into funcDecl map when executing funcDecl 
    in FuncDecl.java, use self to refer to funcDecl

don't push the new frame in function call immediately, create it separately
    copy ref variables into newly created frame(stack of maps) - (get info from FuncDecl.formals and FuncDecl.stmtSeq)
    then push on top of stack
    then execute stmtSeq
